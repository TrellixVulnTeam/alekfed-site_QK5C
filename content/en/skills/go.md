After spending some time using Python alone, I felt that I need some relatively low-level language with a sane threading model (at the operating system level, without tricks with `async`/`await` around a single-threaded event loop) and, well, that has a large and active ecosystem!ðŸ˜… I didn't want to go back to C++ and mess with JVM-based languages, so the choice fell on Go.

In Go, I wrote a couple of small web-services for the e-commerce platform that I developed:

- an intermediate service for dispatching datasets between preprocessors of ML data inputs (based on [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/));

- internal load testing service (based on [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)).

This experience was positive, I would like to use Go more often in the future.

- Captions: although the name of the Go language is not directly related to Japanese, I find it interesting that it sounds similar to èªž (['language'](http://www.romajidesu.com/kanji/%E8% AA% 9E)). Vegeta is written according to [original](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Vegeta) spelling. Fiber is written in katakana to the best of my understanding of the transcription rules.
